# Employee Attrition Prediction

## Introduction
Employee attrition is a critical challenge faced by organizations across industries. High attrition rates can lead to increased costs, reduced productivity, and negative impacts on employee morale. To address this issue, organizations need to identify the factors contributing to attrition and develop strategies to retain top talent.

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict employee attrition using various machine learning models. The steps involved in this project include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model selection, training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

## Load the Data
The dataset used in this project is `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv`. It contains various features related to employee demographics, job roles, and satisfaction levels.

## Data Exploration and Visualization
We explore the dataset to understand the distribution of features and their relationship with attrition. Visualizations include count plots, KDE plots, and pie charts.

## Feature Engineering
We preprocess the data by encoding categorical variables and scaling numerical features. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for machine learning models.

## Model Selection
We select multiple models for training, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). These models are chosen based on their suitability for classification tasks.

## Model Training
We split the data into training and testing sets and train the selected models. Each model is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

## Model Evaluation
We evaluate the models using various metrics and identify the best-performing model. The Random Forest model emerges as the best model based on its performance metrics.

## Hyperparameter Tuning
We perform hyperparameter tuning using RandomizedSearchCV to optimize the Random Forest model. This step helps in improving the model's performance.

## Final Model
The final Random Forest model, after hyperparameter tuning and addressing class imbalance using SMOTE, provides the best performance for predicting employee attrition.

## Conclusion
The Random Forest model, after hyperparameter tuning and addressing class imbalance, provided the best performance for predicting employee attrition. While the model showed good accuracy and precision, further improvements could be made to enhance recall and F1 score. This model can be a valuable tool for HR departments to identify potential attrition risks and take proactive measures to retain employees.

## Summary
The Random Forest model, after hyperparameter tuning and addressing class imbalance, provided the best performance for predicting employee attrition. This model can be a valuable tool for HR departments to identify potential attrition risks and take proactive measures to retain employees.

## Note
This is a simple model and can be improved by adding more data and features. The model can be further optimized by fine-tuning hyperparameters and exploring advanced techniques such as feature engineering and ensemble methods. Additionally, the model can be deployed in a production environment to provide real-time predictions and insights for HR decision-making.
